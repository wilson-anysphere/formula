# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead:

1. Use GitHub's **Private Vulnerability Reporting** / **Security Advisories** for this repository, if available.
2. If that is not available, open an issue with minimal details and request a private contact channel.

We aim to acknowledge reports within **72 hours**.

## Supported versions

This project is currently pre-release. Security fixes will be applied to `main`.
