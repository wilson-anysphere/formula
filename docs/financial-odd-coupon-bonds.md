# Odd-coupon bond functions (ODDF\*/ODDL\*) — Excel parity notes

Excel’s odd-coupon bond functions have a large compatibility surface:

- day-count basis conventions (`basis`)
- end-of-month (EOM) coupon schedules
- settlement / issue / coupon date validation rules
- yield solver robustness

This document is meant to be a **maintainer guide**: if you change or extend these functions, it
should be clear what invariants must be preserved to avoid Excel regressions.

## Functions

Odd *first* coupon period:

- `ODDFPRICE(settlement, maturity, issue, first_coupon, rate, yld, redemption, frequency, [basis])`
- `ODDFYIELD(settlement, maturity, issue, first_coupon, rate, pr, redemption, frequency, [basis])`

Odd *last* coupon period:

- `ODDLPRICE(settlement, maturity, last_interest, rate, yld, redemption, frequency, [basis])`
- `ODDLYIELD(settlement, maturity, last_interest, rate, pr, redemption, frequency, [basis])`

## Where the implementation lives

The core implementation lives at:

- `crates/formula-engine/src/functions/financial/odd_coupon.rs`

Implementation notes and the intended math model are documented inline at:

- `crates/formula-engine/src/functions/financial/bonds_odd.rs`

The thin “Excel built-in” wrappers (argument coercion, error mapping, registration in the
function registry) typically live under:

- `crates/formula-engine/src/functions/financial/`

## Tests and oracle cases

### Unit tests

Primary targeted tests live at:

- `crates/formula-engine/tests/functions/financial_odd_coupon.rs`

Date-ordering equality edge cases are locked via:

- `crates/formula-engine/tests/odd_coupon_date_boundaries.rs`

These tests currently focus on invariants that should *always* hold (e.g. independence from the
workbook date system). As additional edge cases are discovered (EOM schedules, long first coupons,
30/360 boundaries, solver convergence cliffs), add tests here to pin behavior.

### Excel oracle dataset (cross-check against real Excel)

To validate parity against real Excel results, use the Excel oracle harness:

- `tools/excel-oracle/README.md`
- case corpus: `tests/compatibility/excel-oracle/cases.json`
- pinned dataset: `tests/compatibility/excel-oracle/datasets/excel-oracle.pinned.json`

Note: the pinned dataset in CI is currently a **synthetic baseline** generated from the engine
(see the dataset `source.note`). Treat it as a regression test for current engine behavior.
To validate against *real* Excel, regenerate the dataset with
`tools/excel-oracle/run-excel-oracle.ps1` on Windows + Excel (Task 393).

When adding odd-coupon coverage to the oracle corpus, prefer:

- fixed calendar dates (avoid `TODAY()`, `NOW()`, volatile functions)
- explicit `basis` / `frequency`
- cases that cover both Excel 1900 and 1904 date systems (the engine should match in both)

The generator includes a small set of boundary-date equality cases (e.g. `issue == settlement`,
`settlement == first_coupon`, `settlement == last_interest`). The engine currently **allows** these
for odd-coupon bonds (i.e. they can return finite numbers), but this has not yet been validated
against a real Excel oracle dataset. Today, these cases are pinned in the synthetic CI dataset to
catch regressions in engine date validation rules over time; once a real Excel dataset is pinned,
they should serve as true parity checks.

## High-risk compatibility areas

If you modify these functions, re-check these areas carefully:

1. **`basis` day-count mapping**: must match Excel (`0..=4` with specific 30/360 rules).
2. **Coupon schedule generation (anchor date + EOM stepping)**: Excel’s end-of-month behavior is
   subtle; changing schedule stepping can change `E`, accrued interest, and discounting exponents.
   - Current implementation detail (ODDF\*): the regular coupon schedule is generated by stepping
     backward from `maturity` in whole coupon periods (`12 / frequency` months).
   - The schedule is treated as EOM iff `maturity` is itself end-of-month, and month stepping uses
     `date_time::eomonth` (Excel’s `EOMONTH`) in that case (otherwise `date_time::edate`).
   - Current implementation detail (ODDL\*): to compute the regular period length `E`, we step one
     coupon period backward from `last_interest`; EOM detection for that step is based on
     `last_interest` being end-of-month.
   - This logic lives in `crates/formula-engine/src/functions/financial/odd_coupon.rs` (see
     `coupon_schedule_from_maturity` and `coupon_date_with_eom`).
3. **Error behavior**: Excel’s choice of `#NUM!` vs `#VALUE!` varies by argument and coercion path.
4. **Yield domain + solvers**:
   - Domain: the per-period discount base must stay positive (`1 + yld/frequency > 0`, i.e.
     `yld > -frequency`). The boundary `yld == -frequency` produces `#DIV/0!` in Excel; below that is
     `#NUM!`.
   - Solver behavior: Newton-Raphson failures must not silently return incorrect values; when Excel
     converges, we should converge as well (usually via a fallback/bracketing strategy).
