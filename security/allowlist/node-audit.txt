# Allowlisted Node advisory IDs (one per line).
#
# Acceptable identifiers (depending on the audit source):
# - GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
# - CVE-YYYY-NNNN
# - npm advisory numeric IDs (e.g. 1234)
#
# Format:
#   # <reason / tracking issue>
#   <ID>
#
# Notes:
# - Keep this list small and well-justified.
# - Prefer fixing/upgrading dependencies over allowlisting.
# - Remove entries once upstream fixes are available.
