  <!--
    Ensure Linux desktop environments can map `*.parquet` to a stable MIME type.

    Many distros' shared-mime-info database does not include a Parquet glob by
    default, which means a `.desktop` file advertising `MimeType=...parquet`
    would never match when the file manager resolves the file type.

    By shipping this definition inside our .deb/.rpm (and AppImage), package
    install triggers (`update-mime-database`) will register the mapping and make
    Parquet double-click open work reliably.
