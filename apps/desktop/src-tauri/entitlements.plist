      Outbound network access.
      - Required by the updater and any HTTPS/WSS calls made by the desktop backend.
      - Note: this is only enforced when sandboxing is enabled (we do not enable app sandboxing today).
      - If we ever enable the App Sandbox, note that Formula also runs a loopback HTTP listener
        for OAuth redirects; that flow may require `com.apple.security.network.server` as well.

      WKWebView / JavaScriptCore JIT + WebAssembly under the hardened runtime.
      Formula's frontend executes WebAssembly (Pyodide, formula engine worker) and uses
      CSP-enabled `unsafe-eval` / `wasm-unsafe-eval`. Without these, signed/notarized builds can
      launch with a blank WebView or crash when the JS engine tries to allocate JIT memory.

    <!--
      Intentionally *not* enabling:
      - `com.apple.security.cs.disable-executable-page-protection` (broader W+X permission; prefer the more targeted JIT entitlements above)
      - `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` (Formula does not load third-party / unsigned dylibs at runtime)

      If we ever introduce dlopen-based plugins or unsigned external frameworks, revisit.
